Windows service used to retrieve & report weather data.

- Weather data is retrieved using OpenWeatherMap API in combination with the lattitude and longitude of the desired place.
- Retrieved data is stored into an MSSQL Express database.
- Service implements caching mechanism so reduce the need for accessing underlying slower storage layer.
- Service reports location, timestamp, average temperature and the biggest temperature oscillation in Event Viewer.
